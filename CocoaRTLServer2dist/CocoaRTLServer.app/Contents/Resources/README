This code leverages the Osmocom RTL-SDR code heavily.
Their website is here: http://sdr.osmocom.org/trac/wiki/rtl-sdr

This port of their code is written by:

William Dillon <hpux735@gmail.com>

In the majority of cases, the osmocom code is marked by:
    // OSMOCOM RTL-SDR DERIVED CODE
    // END OSMOCOM CODE

    
As their code is GPL v. 2, so is this code.  A copy of the GPL is available
in the COPYING file.

At the current time, only the E4000 and R820t tuners are supported, as they're the only ones I have.
I accept donations if you want ports of other tuners supported.
